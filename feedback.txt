So interesting project! The idea is amazing I really enjoyed learning those chinese simbols.
BUT unfortanelly the structure is very messy. You could make folder for each type of file, for instance.
You could use much more DOM so you don't need a html for each type of symbol. 
IN your script file the function names are not clear about what they do and it is not commented, making it really hard to follow.
